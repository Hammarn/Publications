<h3>Publications</h3>

<p>
  A publication should be represented by one and only one entry. Multiple
  copies may be created in certain scenarios. If you notice any such
  cases, please <a href="{{ reverse_url('contact') }}">report it</a>
  to the site admin so that it can be fixed.
</p>

<h3>Add publication references</h3>

<p>
  The recommended way to add publication references is by DOI or PMID
  (PubMed identifier) using the
  <a href="{{ reverse_url('publication_fetch') }}">fetch feature</a>.
  The system will
  <ol>
    <li>Check whether the publication reference already exists.</li>
    <li>If it does not exist, fetch it from Crossref (DOI) or PubMed (PMID).</li>
    <li>Assign the curator's labels to it.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  A publication reference can also be added "by hand" using the
  <a href="{{ reverse_url('publication_add') }}">add feature</a>.
  This is for publications which do not have neither a DOI nor a
  PMID. Please refrain from adding preprints or publication which will
  eventually get a DOI or PMID. This will just create a head-ache with
  multiple copies.
</p>
<h3>Labels and facilities</h3>

<p>
  Labels are used to denote the facility(-ies) that a publication is
  associated with. Labels may also be used for other purposes, such
  as denoting if a publication reference is incomplete.
</p>
<p>
  Note that the current labels have been loaded from old sources, and
  may contain out-of-date designations of facilities. If you see any
  labels that should be renamed or merged with other labels, please
  <a href="{{ reverse_url('contact') }}">contact</a> the site admin.

<h3>Your account</h3>

<p>
  To get a curator account
  <a href="{{ reverse_url('contact') }}">contact</a> 
  the site admin and ask nicely. There is no way to register your own
  account.  Only facility coordinators etc should be curators in this
  system.
</p>
<p>
  When the site admin has created your account, you will have to set a
  password for it. Follow the instructions.
</p>

<h3>Account and labels</h3>

<p>
  A curator account is associated with one or a few labels which represent
  the facility(-ies) which the curator is responsible for. A curator
  can add and remove the his/her own labels to any publication.
</p>
<p>
  A curator
  cannot change labels for other facilities. If the curator thinks another
  label has been wrongly given to a publication, that curator will have
  to discuss it with the responsible other curator, or with the site admin.
